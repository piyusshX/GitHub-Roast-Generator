# 🛠️ Project Overvie
The GitHub Roast Generator is a lighthearted web app designed to humorously "roast" GitHub profiles. Whether you’ve got countless abandoned repos or an overly dramatic Bio, this tool has a roast ready for you. It’s all in good fun—a way to bring a smile to your face and maybe motivate you to commit a little more often!

This project takes public data from GitHub profiles and generates witty, personalized roasts based on your profile data. Users simply enter their GitHub username, and the app crafts a custom roast for them.

# Project Background
Originally, this project started as an idea to create a LinkedIn Roast Generator. The plan was to scrape data from LinkedIn profiles using Python, but LinkedIn’s strict anti-scraping policies made it nearly impossible. After scraping just 5-10 profiles, the temporary LinkedIn accounts I was using kept getting banned. Due to this, I decided to abandon the LinkedIn Roast Generator and pivoted to the GitHub Roast Generator instead.
